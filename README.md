## Table Design

Movie names with the genre, rating, and actors in it

## Explaination 

Says the movie names, actor names, genres, and ratings. At the bottom, instead of making it put the movie name for as many actors there are in the movie, I had it put them all on the same line using || and STRING_AGG. || concatenates the first and last name.
